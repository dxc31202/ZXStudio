# ZXStudio
ZXStudio is my attempt to create an all singing all dancing Z80 development environment. It is written in C# and includes a real time debugger, an assembler and a disassembler all integrated with my ZXSpectrum emulator Covers all documented and undocumented opcodes with, hopefully, accurate timing. Has the following features: Run full speed Continuous debug Single Step debug Step Over debug Step Out debug Multiple break points The disassembler carries out intelligent disassembly, tries to determine code from data and has ability to perform real time context disassembly This will be extended over time into a complete development environment with a connected spectrum emulator
